B MUMBAI:

GRID: 400 x 400
BUILDINGS: 50k
ANTENNAS: 1014
REWARD: 40M
DESC: Lot of very small antennas and also ones with
range 0 to be placed exactly on the buildings. Very few
big antennas with range between 15 and 30 and only
4 very big ones of range 72, 86, 90 and 100.
APPROACH:
A genetic algorithm could do it given the right amount of time
and the right parameters. We could split antennas into 3 subsets,
big, normal and 0 ranges. Bigs can have a genetic algorithm on their
own to find the best placement. Since they are just 4 the parameters
can be big and the computation can be very deep with not a great impact.
0 ranges can be manually placed, while all the rest can use a less deep
genetic algorithm at the end. 


C METROPOLIS:

GRID: 600 x 600
BUILDINGS: 60k
ANTENNAS: 60k
REWARD: 50M
DESC:
Equal number of buildings and antennas all with
range 0 so each antenna has to be placed exaclty on 
a building. Latency weights are also all 0 so you cannot
get any negative score for buildings and antenna pairs,
only speed connection matters.
Most of the antennas have pretty high
connection speed but few of them have a very low one
and they have to be placed to the building with lowest
speed weights.
APPROACH:
In this scenario we can get an optimal solution. The problem
reduces to an actually very simple one and it is to maximize the sum
of pairwise multiplications of 2 arrays, in this case array of 
antennas connection speeds and array of building speed weights.
To maximize that is simple enough, we just need to sort
both arrays and pair them accordingly:
[1, 3, 2, 5] -> [1, 2, 3, 5]
[3, 3, 6, 1] -> [1, 3, 3, 6] -> 1*1 + 2*3 + 3*3 + 5*6 = MAX


D POLYNESIA:

GRID: 1200 x 1200
BUILDINGS: 40k
ANTENNAS: 1123
REWARD: 50M
DESC: Antenna ranges are pretty small compared to the size of the
map, 50 max so the biggest ones can cover only 0.08% and there are
very few too, if all the antennas were the biggest one of range 50
they all would cover just less then 97% of the map. So precise palcement
is required since actual coverage is way smaller than that.
APPROACH: Since antennas are few a genetic algorithm might work, but
the initial pool must be very big since the coverage is very small.
Also since there are 0 range antennas too, to ease things a bit
those have to be left out from the genetic and placed "manually".
Also antenna speeds varies a lot, there are up to 3 order of magnitude 
differences between them.


E SAN FRANCISCO:

GRID: 2000 x 2000
BUILDINGS: 200k
ANTENNAS: 6257
REWARD: 30M
DESC: Very similar to polynesia, but with a lot more buildings, and
a lot bigger map. Antennas are still very limited and ranges are even
shorter, just a countable amount are big.


F TOKYO:

GRID: 6000 x 6000
BUILDINGS: 350k
ANTENNAS: 32515
REWARD: 200M
DESC: Map is huge, buldings are a lot and antennas are enough
to make a genetic approach very slow. The situation should be similar
to San Francisco, antennas are few and short ranged compared to the map,
we have 0 ranged antennas and speed connections varies from 1 to 4 digits.
This is a monster. 1 night of computation didn't even get to the first
generation, it's too big for a genetic algorithm.
